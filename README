Needs:
	#Besides latex, you need the ieee style bibliography file. So download "IEEEtran.bst" from 
		http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/bibtex/.
	#Move it to /usr/share/texmf/bibtex/bst (For arch linux users)
	#Also, to use the gantt chart you need to install the package pst-gantt which can be found here:
		http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/contrib/pst-gantt/

Compiling:
	./run.sh

By default there are no \cite commands anywhere, so bibtex will tell you that an error was found.
	In order to get rid of that error message just add a citation command somewhere.
